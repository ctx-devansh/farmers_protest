                        The farmers protest was a protest lasting from August of 2020 to December of 2021. This protest was against three farm acts that were passed by the Indian Parliament in late September 2020, majorly by local farmers in Punjab and Haryana states, however, soon farmers from 22 states were involved.

                    MSP and the issue with it
                </div> 
                <div class="text-b">
                    MSP (Minimum support price) is the minimum price set by the government for certain agricultural products. It acts as a 'safety net' for farmers by protecting them from extraneous factors which may affect their earnings. Up until now, it has been a very successful policy since it has effectively helped farmers out of financial fluctuations. The MSPs which have been fixed by the government in India have been completely futile for 14 crops which are covered by the MSP, only paddy and cotton seemed to have a meaningful procurement in the last 3 years (2019-2022). This is because, in fiscal 2019, the government stated that going forward, MSPs would be set at 50% throughout all-India weighted cost of production. MSPs lack a legal base, because of this, the government can make non-consulted changes easily which is problematic for the farmers. It also completely ignores economic logic since it covers 23 crops but it is only effective for rice and wheat since those are the two crops bought in large enough quantities for it to be effective. A law barring purchases of the remaining 21 crops below MSP by any private seller will also fuel high inflation. Mandatory MSPs will cause the agricultural exports to be non-competitive since the government's assured prices are significantly higher than the local and international prices.<br>

                    The problem that farmers have with the new bill that was passed were to do with the lack of use for the farmer. The first bill was placed in order for the farmers to be able to sell their products inter and intra state without any complications with local laws. The second bill's purpose was to ensure that every expected transaction along with anything extra that the farmer may receive from the sponsor is to be clearly mentioned in agreement beforehand but there is no MSP mentioned in the bill which was complicating the process for the farmers further since the price of their product would be at the mercy of their sponsor(s). The last act's purpose was to eliminate the following crops from consideration as essential commodities: cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion, and potatoes. The 2nd and 3rd bills held farmers at a massive disadvantage over their control on their pricing since under some circumstances, the government could impose stock limits upon the listed commodities.

                        Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020<br>
                        This bill:<br>
                        Promotes barrier-free intra-state and inter-state trade of farmer's produce.<br>
                        Proposes an electronic trading platform for direct and online trading of produce.<br> 
                        Allows farmers the freedom to trade anywhere outside state-notified APMC markets.<br>
                        Prohibits state governments or APMCs from levying fees, cess, or any other charge on farmers' produce.

                        Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020<br>
                        Entities that may strike agreements with farmers to buy agricultural produce are defined as “sponsors" and can include individuals, companies, partnership firms, limited liability groups, and societies.<br>
                        The act provides for setting up farming agreements between farmers and sponsors. Any third parties involved in the transaction (like aggregators) will have to be explicitly mentioned in the agreement.<br> 
                        Agreements must have a minimum duration of one cropping season, or one production cycle of livestock. The maximum duration can be five years.<br> 
                        Purchase price of the farming produce—including the methods of determining price—may be added in the agreement.<br>
                        There is no mention of minimum support price (MSP) that buyers need to offer to farmers.<br>
                        Delivery of farmers' produce may be undertaken by either parties within the agreed time frame. Sponsors are liable to inspect the quality of products as per the agreement.<br>
                        In case of seed production, sponsors are required to pay at least two-thirds of the agreed amount at the time of delivery, and the remaining amount to be paid after due certification within 30 days of the date of delivery.<br> 
                        Produce generated under farming agreements are exempt from any state acts aimed at regulating the sale and purchase of farming produce, therefore leaving no room for states to impose MSPs on such produce.<br> 
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-b">
                        Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020<br>

                        The act removes cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion, and potatoes from the list of essential commodities.
                        Government can impose stock holding limits and regulate the prices for the above commodities—under the Essential Commodities, 1955—only under exceptional circumstances. These include war, famine, extraordinary price rise, and natural calamity of grave nature.
                        Stock limits on farming produce to be based on price rise in the market.  They may be imposed only if there is:
                        (i) a 100 percent increase in retail price of horticultural produce 	(ii) a 50 percent increase in the retail price of non-perishable agricultural food items. 
                        <br>
                        The act aims at removing fears of private investors of regulatory influence in their business operations.
                        Gives freedom to produce, hold, move, distribute, and supply produce, leading to harnessing private sector/foreign direct investment in agricultural infrastructure.
                        <br>
                        The Indian parliament passed these three bills during their monsoon session culminating on September 23, 2020.
                        The bills were said to be repealed by Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi on November 19. The bill was then formally repealed on December 1, 2021.
                        <br>
                        What is the issue ?
                        <br>
                        The issue is that it's unclear how this will play out in reality. For one, farmers can already sell to private players in many states but what these bills do is offer a national framework.
                        But farmers are mainly concerned that this will eventually lead to the end of wholesale markets and assured prices, leaving them with no back-up option. That is, if they are not satisfied with the price offered by a private buyer, they cannot return to the mandi or use it as a bargaining chip during negotiations.
